            <p>
                This website was created by me, James Gough, as part of my MSc course in software development. I
                enjoyed the project so much that I decided to create a deployed version of the project and hope to
                continue to develop it further.
                </p>
            <p>
                What sets the website apart from other emotion tracking applications is that it is entirely free and
                never for profit. I don't believe that your data should be a commodity.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are free to completely delete and access your data at any time.
