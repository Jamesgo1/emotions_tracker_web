                Our aim is to provide a simple but effective way for you to build up a picture of how your emotions
                change day to day and the reasons for those changes.
            </p>
            <p>Find out with your own data what makes you happy
                or angry, how days of the week can change your emotions, or even the impact of the weather on your
                emotions. By logging this data, you can improve your emotional awareness and there is <a

                improve emotional wellness.

                Using Dr Paul Ekman's research on the <a href="https://www.paulekman.com/universal-emotions/">seven
                    universal emotions </a> as a starting point, this website offers the opportunity to improve your
                emotional awareness.

                In the words of Dr Ekman himself:
            </p>

            <blockquote class="has-text-black has-background-info-light is-italic">
                In order to have more choice about our emotional reactions, we must first build awareness of the
                emotional behaviors, experiences and triggers that we, and others, face. This process allows us to find
                insight in awareness to help shape our emotional reactions in more thoughtful and constructive ways.
